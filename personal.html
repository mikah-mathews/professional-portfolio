    <h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
    <p>I am a 21 year old Jr Software Developer, working out of the Puget Sound. I use They/Them pronouns. I have been using computers since I was a child and was always interested in what cool things computers could do. As I got older I began to realize how interesting programming was, and got involved with a few different clubs and organizations. When I was 16 I took part in the Girls Who Code Intensive Summer Bootcamp, and it changed my trajectory in life. I am so grateful for the oppertunities that I gained through the program and the skills that I learned. In my free time I enjoy making zines and patches, skateboarding, hiking, punk concerts, walking my dog, political activism and education outreach, and playing the bass guitar. I really enjoy teaching myself new things and developing new skills. I have taught myself to play the guitar and ukelele, which I am now translating over to the bass!</p>
